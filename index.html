                        <h3>Vlone</h3>
                        <p>
                            Following the success of ASAP Mob, fellow member Kamoni Chandler, also known as A$AP K,
                            founded the streetwear label VLONE in 2011. VLONE Hoodies and Vlone Shirt quickly became
                            famous in the streets of Harlem. Shelton, who had previously been the head of A$AP Rocky's
                            merchandise during his tours, worked together with Chandler on the brand. After a falling
                            out Chandler left the brand and Shelton took over. Shelton brought in Edison Chen of CLOT,
                            who handles the design work of the label. He stated in an interview with Mass Appeal that
                            much of his influence came from trying on and stealing clothes with his friends while living
                            in Harlem, feeling the fabrics of high-value brands. Vlone is more than just a brand, it
                            is a style and culture which means "You live alone and you die alone".

                            In 2014, VLONE debuted its first collection. VLONE encountered a partnership with Nike in
                            2017; On July 31, a Nike spokesman confirmed that the Vlone deal with Shelton was
                            terminated following the release of a video of him sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel
                            room.

                            In June 2017, VLONE participated in its first runway show during the 2017 Paris Fashion
                            Week.

                            In 2020, VLONE started collaborating with artists, pushing out merchandise for Juice
                            WRLD, NBA Youngboy, The Weeknd, Nav, and more artists.

                        <h3>Billionaire Boys Club</h3>
                        <p>
                            Billionaire Boys Club, is a streetwear label founded by Pharrell Williams and Nigo in 2003.
                            Its sublabels include ICECREAM, Bee Line, and Billionaire Girls Club.
                            In 2003, singer Pharrell Williams and his manager Rob Walker partnered with fashion designer
                            and A Bathing Ape creator, Nigo, and Japanese graphic designer, Sk8thing, to create
                            Billionaire Boys Club.

                            BBC debuted in Williams' 2003 Frontin' music video. In 2004, ICECREAM, originally a
                            subsidiary of Billionaire Boys Club, unveiled its skate-centric footwear line. ICECREAM
                            graphics feature all-over print motifs of beepers, dollar signs and diamonds. A year later,
                            Billionaire Boys Club branched out from its online origin, setting up a store in Tokyo,
                            Japan and later expanding to New York and London.

                        <h3>Maison Margiela</h3>
                        <p>
                            Maison Margiela, formerly Maison Martin Margiela, is a French luxury fashion house
                            headquartered in Paris and founded in 1988 by Belgian designer Martin Margiela. The house
                            produces both haute couture-inspired artisanal collections and ready-to-wear collections,
                            with the former influencing the designs of the latter. Product lines include womenswear,
                            menswear, fine jewelry, footwear, objects, fragrance, and home goods, among others.
                            Known for deconstructive and avant-garde designs with unconventional materials, Maison
                            Margiela has traditionally held live shows in unusual settings, for example empty metro
                            stations and street corners. Models' faces are often obscured by fabric or long
                            hair to direct attention to the clothes and design. With Maison Martin Margiela going
                            public in 2002, Margiela resigned as creative designer in 2009 and John Galliano was
                            appointed to the role in 2014. The company has collaborated on displays and designs with
                            Barneys New York, Converse, G-Shock Opening Ceremony, Hermès, H&M,
                            L’Oreal, and Swarovski.
